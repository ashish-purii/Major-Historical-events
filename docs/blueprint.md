- Homepage Grid: Display a responsive grid of eight clickable cards on the homepage, each featuring the title, date, a representative image, and a 1-2 line teaser.

- Tech Stack & Structure: Structure the application using Next.js and Tailwind CSS (or plain HTML/CSS/JS for minimal setup). Provide a clear folder/file tree.
